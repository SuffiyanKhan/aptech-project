                                            kept safe until you have the watch in your hands. The WatchVisita team is

                                            Many factors contribute to a watch's total price. In addition to the watch's
                                            listing price, there are additional costs such as packaging, insurance,
                                            shipping, and taxes (e.g. VAT or import). Depending on whether you order
                                            your watch from a domestic or foreign seller, you may incur other costs.
                                            Contact the seller for more information.

                                            around the globe. Many dealers take national holidays off in addition to
                                            other vacation days. Increased demand can also result in a backlog of
                                            inquiries, leading to delayed responses. Please make sure your message is in
                                            one of the languages listed next to the contact form and give the seller an
                                            appropriate amount of time to respond.</p>

                                            counterfeit watches. We verify every dealer on our platform, and many of
                                            them have been selling watches on WatchVisita for years. The Trusted Seller
                                            seal is further evidence of a dealer's trustworthiness. We immediately
                                            suspend any dealer proven to be offering fakes or replicas.

                                            If you're concerned about a watch's authenticity, research its current
                                            market value. Watches from luxury brands like Rolex, Breitling, and others
                                            rarely sell for only a few hundred dollars. If you have any doubts, you
                                            should refrain from making a purchase. Prices that seem too good to be true
                                            probably are. Instead, you should report your concerns by clicking the
                                            "Report listing" link on the listing page.
                                            <br><br>
                                            Please note that authentic watches are sometimes repaired using replacement
                                            parts. These components are not always a 1:1 match with those used in the
                                            original. Non-original components are especially common in vintage watches.
                                            In such instances, the dealer must indicate all replacement parts in the
                                            listing.

                                            suggestion by selecting "Suggest a price." If you see a "Questions about

                                            The seller will receive your question via email. While we share the seller's

                                            Service on WatchVisita is the most secure payment method. You transfer the
                                            amount due to an escrow account, where it is kept safe until you have the
                                            watch in your hands. The WatchVisita team is always available to help ensure
                                            the entire purchasing process runs smoothly.

                                            If the private seller doesn't offer the Escrow Service on WatchVisita as a
                                            payment method, we suggest meeting the seller in person at a safe location.
                                            Ideally, meet them at an established watch dealer's shop where the watch can
                                            be inspected immediately. Other alternatives include PayPal or using an
                                            external escrow service.

                                        <p>Dealers and manufacturers often voluntarily offer warranties that cover the
                                            cost of repairing or replacing a damaged timepiece. The warranty usually
                                            applies to either the entire watch or the functionality of certain
                                            components. Most warranties expire after a pre-determined period of time.

                                            <br>
                                            Online dealers may offer additional warranties. Before purchasing a watch,
                                            be sure to look into what the dealer's warranty covers and for how long.
                                            Once you've received your watch, make sure the warranty card is dated and
                                            stamped or signed. The date on the warranty card should match the date on
                                            your receipt. If this is not the case, your warranty may be void.

                                            whenever possible. If this option is unavailable, purchases from our
                                            professional dealers are always secure. WatchVisita conducts an extensive
                                            review of every dealer's identity and legitimacy during the registration
                                            process. Dealers provide personal information, such as their trade license
                                            and references from other dealers. There is no reason to be suspicious of
                                            dealers who require advance payment via wire transfer.

                                            When buying from a private seller, we do not recommend advance payment for
                                            security reasons. If the private seller requires advance payment, and you
                                            absolutely want to buy the watch, it is in your best interest to review the
                                            legitimacy of both the seller and their offer. For example, you can request
                                            references, more pictures of the watch, or personal documents. You should
                                            also consider using a reliable escrow service. If you have any doubts about
                                            the seller's trustworthiness, you should not go through with the purchase.

                                            PayPal:
                                            <br><br>
                                            You can take steps to guarantee your security when paying with a credit
                                            card. Make sure your connection is secure. To do so, check that the website
                                            URL begins with "https" and that there is a padlock symbol in your browser's
                                            address bar. Regularly monitor your credit card statements. Many credit card
                                            providers have a zero-liability policy. This means that customers are not
                                            liable for fraudulent charges as long as they report them immediately. For
                                            more information about using PayPal, please contact PayPal directly.
                                            Reminder: Payments made to "Family and Friends" are not covered by PayPal's
                                            buyer protection policy. WatchVisita cannot offer support in such instances.

                                            Both buyer and seller must agree to the use of an escrow service. Please
                                            only accept information the escrow service provides directly to you. Do not
                                            rely on emails forwarded by the seller.

                                        <p>You should look into the dealer's return policy before making a purchase.
                                            Some dealers only accept returns on watches with their seals and packaging
                                            intact. It is in your best interest to fully insure the return shipment and
                                            to comply with the return deadline. We recommend reaching out to the dealer
                                            to discuss the process before returning the item.
